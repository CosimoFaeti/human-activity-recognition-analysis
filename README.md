# Human Activity Recognition Analysis  
This repository contains my project for the *Data Mining II course* of my Master's degree in Data Science and Business Informatics at Universit√† di Pisa.
The aim of the project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of different machine learning models on 
*Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones* data set. Specifically, it concerns experiments that have been carried out
with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS,
WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone on the waist. Using
the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the smartphone were captured 3-axial linear acceleration and
3-axial angular velocity.
